# My university's optimization introductory course homework

Code was written in Julia using `Pluto`. I did not bother translating comments to English, so if something is unclear you can just ask in Github's discussions tab.

## Setup

```sh
> cd optimization-homework
julia> ]
(@vx.x) pkg> activate .
(optimization-homework) pkg> instantiate
```

## Usage

Simply lauch Pluto notebooks from the Julia repl:

```sh
julia> import Pluto
julia> Pluto.run()
```
